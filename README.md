# python-challenge
This is a project that I completed on 11.10.22 in VSC and Jupyter Notebook.

#pybank is my analysis of a csv budget data file where I analyzed the profit and loss over time.

#pypoll is my analysis of a csv election data file where I analyzed a large set of votes from different counties and with three different candidates.
  I tallied how many votes that each candidate received and the percentage of votes.  Then I calculated who the winner was.
  
 I printed two .txt files of the output of these scripts using :
 
 python main.py >"analysis".txt
